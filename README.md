This project focuses on developing an efficient online shopping system that caters to two key user 
roles: administrators in charge of supervising the store's operations and shoppers who explore and 
make purchases. The system is meant to provide a variety of specific functions, with certain 
activities restricted to administrators only. Admin-only features include the ability to add new 
products, sell items, manage product details, create user accounts, update user information, 
examine a full user list, execute and finalize orders, and save product and user data to files.

Shoppers, on the other hand, have access to a specific set of actions that are targeted to their needs. 
They can add preferred products to their shopping baskets, evaluate the contents of their baskets, 
make changes to their basket selections, and place orders for their chosen items. Furthermore, both 
administrators and shoppers have access to shared tasks such as listing available products, while 
listing shoppers is only available to administrators.

To begin utilizing the system, it imports product and user data from text files, and each user must 
provide their user ID. If the entered ID is not discovered in the system, access is blocked 
immediately. Overall, this system provides a comprehensive solution for managing an online store, 
allowing administrators to regulate products and users while allowing customers to smoothly 
browse, shop, and manage their orders.
